### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name's Rob

#### I'm a press officer excited to career change into software development. I'm enrolled in the Command Shift bootcamp, mastering the latest development tools, and techniques. As the host of the Codewords podcast, I share insights from amazing developers worldwide. Drop me a message and let's grab a virtual coffee chat. 

Iâ€™ve got a passion for problem-solving and learning new technologies, with a slight obsession with linear gradients.

If Iâ€™m not at my desk youâ€™ll find me cycling or taking on a hiking trail.

Skills: HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React | Docker | SQL | Postman | Express.js | Firebase | Npm | GitHub | CLI | Agile | TDD | OOP
